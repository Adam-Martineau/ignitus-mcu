1. Open Thonny
2. In Thonny open the main.py file
3. Connect your RP2040 board to your computer
4. Use the menu on the bottom right to select the "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)" interpretor
5. Press the red stop button at the top of the editor to open and start the python terminal 
6. Locate the python terminal at the bottom of the editor 
7. Use the green run button at the top of the editor

To run the functional tests:
